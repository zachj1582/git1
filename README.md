## ********************************
## Git Instructions
- [ ] Create a template copy of this repository by clicking : "Use this template"
- [ ] Name the repository the same name as the master template repository.  
- [ ] Add your TA as collaborator
- [ ] Clone YOUR repo to your local computer
- [ ] For this assignment, you will be following the instructions below:
## ********************************

* Copy the html file from the prework (Markup Exercise) and paste it in the new cloned folder.  (e.g. index.html)
* Create a new file using the command line called notes.txt
* Add some text to the notes.txt file.
* Create a new branch called html-branch
* Move the html file to the html-branch and leave the notes.txt file in the master branch
* Add three &lt;p&gt; tags with "lorem ipsum" paragraph text to the html file, which should now be on the html-branch.  You can find "lorem ipsum" at the following link : https://loremipsum.io/
* Save your changes, then add, commit and push your files up to the html-branch repository on github. Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* Refresh your repository to make sure your file was uploaded and the html-branch was updated.
* Create another branch called text-branch
* Move the notes.txt from master to the text-branch. The master branch should now be completely empty at this point, aside from the README file.
* Check the status, add, commit and push your changes to the text-branch.  Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* Add 3 additional lorem-ipsum paragraphs into the notes.txt file which should now be on the text-branch.
* Commit and push your additional changes to the text-branch on GitHub.  Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* On GitHub, verify that the master branch only has the README.md file with nothing else.  Verify that the html-branch and the text-branch each have a respective .html and .txt file.
Submit a pull request for both the html-branch and the text-branch to be merged into master.  Add your TA as a collaborator for both Pull Requests (PR).  

**Bonus Goal: 

* Merge The <code>merge-this-branch</code> into the master branch.  If you run into a merge conflict, get rid of the bonus goals bullet on the master branch of the README file and replace it with this bullet.  Also, keep all the data from both the merge-this-brarnch and the master branch
